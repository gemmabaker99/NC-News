To create the environment variables, create a new .env.test file containing PGDATABASE=PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
Then create a new .env.development file containing
PGDATABASE=nc_news
Once these files are created, both databases can be accessed.

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)
